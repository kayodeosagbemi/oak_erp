Peaceful Peace (“The Company”) offers different investment plans to their customers who are called “Investor”. 

An investor can make an investment (“Investment”) under one  investment plans at a time. But may have many investments concurrently. 

What are the investment plans?
There are currently (as at 20-July-2020) four (4) investment plans in Peaceful Peace Limited. They are:
Gold (Profit of 8% every 2 months) (Tenor of 2 months)
Diamond (Profit of 12% every 2 months) (Tenor of 4 months)
Platinum (Profit of 15% every 2 months) (Tenor of 8 months)
Premium (Profit of 20% every 2 months) (Tenor of one year i.e. 12 months)

When should profit be paid for an investment plan?
An investment plan can either pay out (make due) the profit exactly every 2 months or defer the payment till maturity of the investment. There is a setting that controls this. See “Payment Schedule” below for more on this.

Is the tenor of an investment flexible or must it match the tenor of the chosen plan exactly?
An investment plan can optionally allow the investment to have a lesser tenor than the official tenor of the investment plan but not equal to the next lesser investment plan.


An Investment has an investment reference, a principal amount in Kobo (or appropriate base unit of the currency), a currency, a tenor, a tenor unit (days, months, weeks, years) , a start date, an interest, a payment schedule (“Payment Schedule”), and a status (Active|Expired). 

When an investment is started, an investment agreement document is signed and sent to the investor as an evidence.

Can an investment be rolled over?
An investment can be rolled over at maturity into another investment with another tenor. In this case a new record is created with it's own ID and the “old/former” investment's ID becomes the related investment ID of the new investment.

A Payment Schedule lists the dates, amounts to be paid, the kind of the schedule (payin|payout) and payment status (Paid|Missed|Canceled) of that amount to be paid on the investment.
The investor makes a payment to initiate their investment. The date on which payment is made is the actual start date of the investment.

Can an investment be pre-terminated?
An investor can optionally pre-terminate their investment. (NB: nothing done on the ER model for this yet)

What accounting entries should be recorded on the system? 
Or 
Will accounting entries be stored on the system?
A payment entry is made from a reference (account) to another reference(account) for different purposes such as Investment principal payment, schedule  payment, payment of referrers fees/rewards, salary payment.
